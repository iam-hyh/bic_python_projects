# Project Hangman - guess the word
Berlin International College

This project requires building a word guessing game (hangman) you have to think of a word or letter then suggest it to the program and within a certain number of guesses. if you don’t get the secret word right you lose.

It is challenging and i love challenges yet sometimes i hate it! but it’s all part of the learning process and i enjoyed figuring out how things work.


Things to keep in mind:
- Read the word list from external file.
- The user start with fixed number of guessed.
- User has to input alphabets only.
- If the user input wrong guess we reduce the number of guesses left. 
- Show the number of guesses left.
- If the user try to input same letter again we prompt the user to try again. 
- If there are no more guesses then game over.


I intend to continue contribute to the project if i got the time…
- Dynamic hint with picture.
- Build a Level system or difficulty. 
- Add score.
- Create GUI. 
- Add sound effects.
